There are many trends that you can find in this data. One of the main ones I noticed is the test score trend with school size. There appears to be a correlation between the size of the school and the passing rate of the students in both math and reading. The data shows that as a school size increases above 2,000 students that the overall passing percentage decreases; 90% overall passing for both small and medium schools and 58% passing for large schools. This could be due to lack of time from teachers, personalized instruction or resources.

Another trend I observed from the data is the difference between charter and distrct schools. The charter schools had a passing percentage of 90% while the district had a 53% overall passing rate. I would be interested to do further analysis to see if the charter schools had a smaller size or a higher budget to student ratio which could contribute to this difference.
